    DataPlaceholders are just minimal, low-weight auxiliary objects whose main

    serve as the keys to map the actual input data to their appropriate Step.
    They are not arrays/tensors, nor contain any shape/type information whatsoever.

    Steps are called on and output DataPlaceHolders. DataPlaceholders are
    produced and consumed exclusively by Steps, so you shouldn't need to
